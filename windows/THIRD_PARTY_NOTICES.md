# Windows third-party notices

This file records the principal direct Windows dependencies. It is not a substitute for the license texts and notices required by every dependency included in a particular packaged artifact.

## PyQt6 and Qt 6

PyQt6 is distributed by Riverbank Computing under the GNU GPL v3 and a commercial license. The bundled Qt runtime has its own GPL/LGPL/commercial terms. A Windows distributor must select and comply with a valid licensing path and include all required license materials.

## PyQt6-Fluent-Widgets

PyQt6-Fluent-Widgets is declared by its package metadata as GPLv3.

## requests

requests is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Beautiful Soup

beautifulsoup4 is licensed under the MIT License.

## PyInstaller

PyInstaller is licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later with its exception for building and distributing packaged applications. PyInstaller's license does not replace the licenses of the application or bundled libraries.

## Python and transitive packages

The Python runtime and transitive packages bundled by PyInstaller retain their respective licenses and notice requirements. Before a public Windows Release, generate an inventory from the clean release environment, include the corresponding license texts, and compare that inventory with the final portable archive.

## Release gate

The FluentMai product repository currently has no declared project-level `LICENSE`, and no GPL/commercial-license compliance choice has been recorded for the Windows UI stack. Therefore this notice is sufficient only for development CI evidence; it does not make the current Windows artifact ready for public release.
