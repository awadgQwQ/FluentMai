| Platform | Status | Download | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | Beta | [Android Release](https://github.com/Daozhu1007/FluentMai/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta) | Primary maintained platform |
| iOS | Experimental Alpha | [unsigned IPA](https://github.com/Daozhu1007/FluentMai/releases/tag/v0.2.0-ios-alpha.1) | User self-signing required; iOS 17+ |
| Windows | Alpha / Development | Source only | Independent desktop implementation under `windows/` |

FluentMai is an unofficial, local-first score companion for players of the mainland China version of maimai DX. This product repository carries three independent platform implementations. Android is currently the most mature platform; iOS and Windows remain experimental.

The platforms do not promise identical features, storage formats, or release dates. Android and iOS share selected Kotlin Multiplatform domain code in `core/model`; Windows remains a separate Python/PyQt6 application. Android data migration and Room schema guarantees do not apply to iOS or Windows.

## Platform guides

- [Android](docs/platforms/android.md) — Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, and the current public Beta.
- [iOS](docs/platforms/ios.md) — SwiftUI with the KMP domain layer and a real unsigned `iphoneos arm64` IPA for self-signing.
- [Windows](docs/platforms/windows.md) — the independent PyQt6 desktop codebase, currently source-only.

## Product scope

Across the product, FluentMai focuses on importing, validating, browsing, and analyzing score data locally. Platform capabilities currently differ:

- Android provides the broadest feature set: Wahlap import, Room persistence, quarantine, B35/B15 and Rating analysis, chart search, plate progress, trends, recommendations, and optional user-triggered uploads.
- iOS is an experimental SwiftUI client backed by the shared KMP score/Rating domain layer. Its unsigned IPA is a real device build, but it must be signed by the user before installation.
- Windows provides an independent local SQLite database, manual import flows, score and chart browsing, catalog caches, and a PyQt6 desktop UI. It does not share Android's database or migration path.

See [Product Scope](docs/PRODUCT_SCOPE.md), [Privacy Model](docs/PRIVACY_MODEL.md), and [Third-Party Notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for the detailed boundaries.

## Releases

Existing releases remain unchanged:

- `v0.2.0-beta` — Android Beta, distributed as a debug-signed test APK.
- `v0.2.0-ios-alpha.1` — iOS Experimental Preview, distributed as an unsigned `iphoneos arm64` IPA.
- Windows does not yet have a public release. CI artifacts are development evidence, not a Windows release.

Future platform-specific tags use these forms:

- `vX.Y.Z-android-beta.N`
- `vX.Y.Z-ios-alpha.N`
- `vX.Y.Z-windows-alpha.N`

Each platform follows an independent release cycle. A shared tag should be considered only if versions and features genuinely become synchronized.

## Repository layout

- `app/`, `feature/`, and most `core/` modules — Android application and its Kotlin domain/data layers.
- `core/model/` — Kotlin Multiplatform domain code shared by Android and iOS.
- `iosApp/` — experimental SwiftUI application.
- `windows/` — independent Python/PyQt6 Windows application.
- `scripts/ios/` and `scripts/windows/` — platform build and validation helpers.
- `docs/platforms/` — per-platform status, setup, build, and limitation notes.
- `.github/workflows/` — path-isolated Android, iOS, and Windows validation.

## Build and test

Android on Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

iOS requires macOS, Xcode, JDK 17, and XcodeGen. See [the iOS platform guide](docs/platforms/ios.md).

Windows:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r windows/requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q windows/tests
.\scripts\windows\smoke_test.ps1 -Mode source
.\scripts\windows\build_portable.ps1
```

Detailed Windows commands and known limitations are in [windows/README.md](windows/README.md).

Authentication URLs, tokens, cookies, raw imported pages, databases, logs, and user score data are deliberately excluded from the repository.

## Privacy and security

- Never commit real Cookies, Authorization headers, Import Tokens, LXNS tokens, full authentication URLs, raw Wahlap HTML, user databases, or diagnostic dumps.
- Android and Windows use separate local databases; no cross-platform migration guarantee currently exists.
- Uploads to supported community services are optional and user-triggered.
- Release signing credentials, certificates, and passwords are not stored in this repository.
- Unlicensed game artwork is not bundled with the Windows source or CI artifact; covers are resolved from user cache or runtime providers.
