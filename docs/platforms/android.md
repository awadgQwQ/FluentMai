# Android platform

## Status

Android is FluentMai's primary maintained platform and is currently published as Beta. The existing `v0.2.0-beta` release remains the current Android download.

- Minimum Android version: Android 8.0 (`minSdk 26`)
- Target SDK: 34
- Current application version: `0.2.0-beta` (`versionCode 2`)
- Technology: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, coroutines, Ktor, and modular Gradle

## Build and test

Requirements are JDK 17, an Android SDK capable of API 34 builds, and either `local.properties` with `sdk.dir` or a configured `ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`.

Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

Unix/macOS:

```sh
./gradlew test
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is generated under `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

## Data and privacy

Android stores validated score data in its local Room database. Import validation, deduplication, and quarantine are Android product features. New upload tokens and raw import pages are kept out of ordinary persistent storage by the current implementation.

Android Room migrations apply only to Android. They do not migrate data to iOS or Windows.

## Release notes

The current Beta APK is debug-signed because trusted release signing material is intentionally absent from the repository. Do not change `versionCode`, `versionName`, tags, or existing release assets merely as part of monorepo maintenance.
